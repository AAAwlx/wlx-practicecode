 Every year,my school will hold the summer camp activity,I love to take part in this activity so much.That is because I can have a lot of fun with my friends.What's more,I can take a break from the study time and enjoy my moment.Last year,we went to the country farm and experienced the life there.I was so impressed by the clean river and simple lifestyle.We woke up very early.While wandering on the country road,We relaxed ourselves a lot.The country was so quiet and the air was so fresh.I never woke up so early in the city.Though life here was simple.I liked it.l was so close to the nature and could appreciate its beauty.I felt really peaceful in my heart.l am so looking forward to the summer camp activity this year and I want to experience the different things.
